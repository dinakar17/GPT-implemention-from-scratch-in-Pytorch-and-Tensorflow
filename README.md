# GPT implementation in Pytorch and TensorFlow

SimpleGPT.py is a simple and readable implementation of GPT for beginners in Pytorch. It is based on the paper [Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) by Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever.

Heavily Inspired by nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy. The code is based on the GPT from Scratch Tutorial by [Andrej Karpathy](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY)
